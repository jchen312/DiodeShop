# Diode Shop App
## Description
This app will be created to help users purchase custom diodes. It will sell diodes ranging from normal, schottkey, and zener diodes. It will be able to determine the mounting style of the diode, the maxiumum forward current, forward voltage drop, and reverse current, along with the rated voltage. 


## Documentation

Year two concepts in use:

- Worked on Graphics and GUI elements such as text, combo boxes, and buttons. 

- Work on Exception handling (try and catch blocks)

- Overloading

- Inheritance

- Two-dimensional Array- need to finish implementing, but it will help display all of the data that will be collected. 

- collections with the use of the ArrayList class


Potential To Dos: 

Enhanced for loop to count the elements in the arrays

- overriding if i overwrite the ToString() method.

- clean out all of the files when done

The main screen of the diode shop displays any previous orders of diodes the user may have created. There are different tabs with different diodes as well, as different types of diodes have different traits. Different types of diodes can be viewed by clicking their respective tab. It also has user input in the form of a few buttons. 

If the user wishes to add a new Diode order, they mey click on the "Add New" button on the bottom right corner. 

If the User wants to refresh the three tables of diode orders, they can click the "Update" button.

This is the screen for the creating a diode order. It has the main basic essentials. 


This screen displays diode-type specific information for the user to fill out.
