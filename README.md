## Documentation

Year two concepts in use:

- Worked on Graphics and GUI elements such as text, combo boxes, and buttons. 

- Work on Exception handling (try and catch blocks)

- Overloading

- Inheritance

- Two-dimensional Array- need to finish implementing, but it will help display all of the data that will be collected.

Potential To Dos: 

Enhanced for loop to count the elements in the arrays
